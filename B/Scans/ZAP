STEP 1 — Mapping WebGoat with ZAP (YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST)
➤ Action:

In Firefox, manually browse WebGoat for 1–2 minutes.

Go to:

Login page

Register page

Any lesson page (like “Injection”)

Any link on the left sidebar

Goal: Let ZAP “see” the site structure.

➤ In ZAP:

Check Sites tab → you should see a tree like:

webgoat.local
   /WebGoat
      /login
      /css
      /js
      /Home
      /PasswordReset
      ...


✔ This is “mapping”.

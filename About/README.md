# 🌑 ShadowInject Lab — Definition

**ShadowInject Lab** is a hands-on web application security project where I analyze, exploit, and document real-world vulnerabilities using **OWASP ZAP** and **WebGoat**.  
The project focuses on uncovering hidden or “shadow” weaknesses in web applications—such as **SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**—and understanding how attackers exploit them.

The name combines:

- **Shadow** → vulnerabilities that remain unseen during normal use  
- **Inject** → attacker techniques like SQLi and XSS payload injection  
- **Lab** → an intentionally vulnerable environment (WebGoat) scanned and exploited using OWASP ZAP

## 🔍 Purpose of the Project

To simulate real-world web attacks inside a controlled environment and gain practical experience in:

- Identifying vulnerabilities using **OWASP ZAP**  
- Understanding each vulnerability’s root cause  
- Manually exploiting SQLi, XSS, and CSRF  
- Documenting findings  
- Recommending mitigation strategies

## 🧠 Short Summary

**ShadowInject Lab is a complete practical demonstration of web application penetration testing using WebGoat as the target and OWASP ZAP as the analysis engine.  
It showcases your ability to detect, exploit, and secure common web vulnerabilities.**
